# Guess The Flag

### This is my personal extension of Hacking With Swift project Guess The Flag.  
### I've invested more time than I'd like to admit in developing this minimal app, but I've enjoyed experimenting with tools like UIButton, CALayer, and CGAffineTransform.

## Key Components:

1. **Interactive UIButton:**
   - Enhanced user engagement with custom-styled `UIButton` elements.
   - Implemented dynamic animations, shadows, and borders for a polished look.

2. **Timer integration:**
   - Incorporated a countdown timer using Swift's `Timer` class.
   - Managed game progression and user time constraints for added experience.

3. **UIAlertController:**
   - Utilized `UIAlertController` to deliver personalized messages.
   - Customized alert styles to provide feedback and guide the user.
