# Guess The Flag

Project 2 from Hacking With Swift.

***Learned about:***
- Assets and @2x/@3x images
- `UIButton`, `CALayer`, `UIColor`
- `UIAlertController`
- Animations effect with `CGAffineTransform`
- Implemented `UserDefaults` so now it saves the playerâ€™s highest score

Also I tried to do some customizations such as adding custom fonts and setting up a timer.

## Extra:
- Added a new view that shows the Leaderboards
- Added sounds through `AVFoundation` for correct and wrong answer
