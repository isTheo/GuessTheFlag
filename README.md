# Guess The Flag

Project 2 from Hacking With Swift.

- Learned about @2x and @3x images
- Asset catalogs
- UIButton, CALayer, UIColor
- UIAlertController

I've enjoyed experimenting with `UIButton`, `UIColor`, `CALayer`.  
Also, I tried to do some customizations, such as setting up a timer, fonts, and animations for buttons using `CGAffineTransform`.
