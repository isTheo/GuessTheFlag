# Guess The Flag

Project 2 from Hacking With Swift.

- Learned about @2x and @3x images
- Assets
- UIButton, CALayer, UIColor
- UIAlertController

I've enjoyed experimenting with `UIButton`, `UIColor`, `CALayer`.  
Also, I tried to do some customizations, such as setting up a timer, fonts, and animations for buttons using `CGAffineTransform`.
 
## Update:
- Implemented `UserDefaults` so now it saves the playerâ€™s highest score
- Added a new view that shows the Leaderboards
- Added sounds through `AVFoundation` for correct and wrong answer
