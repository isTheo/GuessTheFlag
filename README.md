# Guess The Flag

### I've likely invested more time than necessary in this basic project, but I've enjoyed experimenting with tools such as UIButton, UIColor, CALayer, CGAffineTransform, setting up a timer, and customizing fonts.

## Key Components:

1. **Interactive UIButton:**
   - Enhanced user engagement with custom-styled `UIButton` elements.
   - Implemented dynamic animations, shadows, and borders for a polished look.

2. **Timer integration:**
   - Incorporated a countdown timer using Swift's `Timer` class.
   - Managed game progression and user time constraints for added experience.

3. **UIAlertController:**
   - Utilized `UIAlertController` to deliver personalized messages.
   - Customized alert styles to provide feedback and guide the user.
 


### Future Enhancements:
- As I progress in my learning I plan to implement sound effects, music and a live system to modernize the game.
