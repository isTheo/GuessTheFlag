# Guess The Flag

I've likely invested more time than necessary in this project, but I've enjoyed experimenting with tools such as `UIButton`, `UIColor`, `CALayer`, `CGAffineTransform`, setting up a timer, and customizing fonts.

## What I have mainly worked on:

1. **UIButton:**
   - Implemented dynamic animations, shadows, and borders for a polished look.

2. **Timer integration:**
   - Incorporated a countdown timer using Swift's Timer class to add a competitive edge

3. **UIAlertController:**
   - Utilized `UIAlertController` to deliver personalized messages.
 


### Future Enhancements:
- As I progress in my learning I plan to implement sound effects, music and a lives system to modernize the game.
